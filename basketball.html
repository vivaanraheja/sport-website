    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
        rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm)
        in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high
        to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own
        hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
        After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two
        or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation
        play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International
        Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts,
        was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students
        occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as
        either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a
        ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote
        the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket
        with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point
        scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked
        out with a long dowel after each scored basket.<br>
        Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football" were made, at
        the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other
        sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause bounce
        passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and
        this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to
        be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day). The first balls made specifically for basketball were
        brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to
        players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of
        the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball
        movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.[dubious
        discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.

    <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
    <p>Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations;
        international and NBA rules are used in this section.<br>

        The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from
        above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a
        shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75
        metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games. A
        one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made. After a team has scored from
        a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point
        beyond the endline of the court where the points were scored.

    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with
        baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets,
        scoreboards, alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.</p><br>


        <p>other than these there are many other things in basketball like: fouls, positions, techniques and etc.</p>
