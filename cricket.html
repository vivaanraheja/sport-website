    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
        22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
        batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between
        the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the
        field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
        include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
        before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
        ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee
        in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical
        information.</p>
    <h2>Forms Of Cricket</h2>
    <p>Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being
        a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test
        matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they
        wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury
        caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam
        enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p>
    <h2>Earlist reference</h2>
    <p>The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the
        expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.
        The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of
        which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United
        Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held
        implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more
        specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In
        cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is
        thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend. The cricket historian
        Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to
        and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended
        target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away
        from it".
        It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England,
        sometime during the medieval period.[4] Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite
        reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old
        Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land
        and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that.</p>
    <h2>Laws</h2>
    <p>In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the
        Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known
        version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London</p>
