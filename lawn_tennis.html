    <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two
        teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a
        hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game
        is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is
        unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th-century northern France, where a ball was struck
        with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm"), which
        evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern
        style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris
        "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over
        Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a
        large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also
        suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis
        player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a
        court set up at the Louvre Palace.</p>
    <h2>Court</h2>
    <p>Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide
        for singles matches and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is
        required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court,
        parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of
        diameter no greater than 0.8 cm (1/3 in). The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet
        (0.91 m) high in the centre.[67] The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the doubles court on each side or,
        for a singles net, 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the singles court on each side.

    <h2>Tournaments</h2>
    <p>Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's
        singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be
        organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players.
        Example of this include the Orange Bowl and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for
        players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis.[98] In the four Grand Slam tournaments,
        the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.<br>

        Most large tournaments seed players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well
        a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain
        competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating
        Program (NTRP), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this
        system would rate 3.0-4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.
